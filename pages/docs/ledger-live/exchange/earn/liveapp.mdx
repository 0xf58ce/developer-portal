# Earn Provider's LiveApp

A LiveApp is your dapp (web application) running within Ledger Live's embedded browser. 

An Earn LiveApp (offering Ledger Live users staking services) is accessible through various entry points in Ledger Live:
- The **Accounts** section: where users can view the list of their accounts and are provided with options to stake available assets.
- The **Discover** section: where users can explore a curated catalog of dapps.
- The **Earn** section: where users can track their current staking positions and stake additional assets on eligible accounts.

## How to create your LiveApp
There are two ways to integrate your dapp into Ledger Live:
1. **dAppBrowser (EVM only)**: by creating a manifest, pointing it to the dAppBrowser, you can easily integrate your dApp into Ledger Live.
2. **The Ledger Services Kit**: a Javascript library allowing your dapp to interact with Ledger wallet devices (for instance, to sign a transaction) and access information from the connected Ledger wallet (such as the wallet address).

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for Ledger Live, please follow the [Discover documentation](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/ledger-live/discover/getting-started).

## LiveApp UX requirements

Your LiveApp must respect some general UX requirements:
- 0-click connect to the wallet (user's wallet must be automatically connected when opening your LiveApp)
- Login through other wallets must not be possible
- Design must be responsive for optimal display on all devices
- After a successful transaction (staking/unstaking, delegation, rewards claiming..), a confirmation page with the transaction hash must be displayed to users, allowing them to easily confirm its status.
- If applicable, the staking method (such as native staking, liquid staking, etc.) should be displayed to users, along with the names of the validators to whom the assets are delegated.

The Ledger team will review and validate your LiveAppâ€™s user flow and ensure compliance with the guidelines mentioned above.

If a token representing the staking position is issued to users (wether it is liquid or not), please inform Ledger of the token's name and address.

## Manifest update

If your liveApp interacts with smart contracts that you don't own and are already clear signed by another LiveApp, you must update your manifest to specify this dependency. 

For example, if your LiveApp interacts with eigenlayer smart contracts (that have already been clear signed and used by other LiveApps), then your LiveApp's manifest must include the following:

```json
"dependency": [
  "eigenlayer"
]
```

Please contact the Ledger team to confirm whether a third-party smart contract is already clear signed, and which value to use in your manifest for it.
