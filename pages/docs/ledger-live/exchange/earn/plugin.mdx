# Earn Provider's plugin

A plugin (or Leger device plugin) ensures that, instead of signing raw and often confusing blockchain data (blind signing), the user receives a clear, human-readable summary of the transaction details on their Ledger device (clear signing). 

To implement clear signing in your LiveApp, you need to develop your own dedicated Ledger plugin. This is a requirement for your LiveApp to be integrated with Ledger Live.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">
All smart contracts your LiveApp interacts with must be clear signed. This includes staking/unstaking, rewards claiming, or any delegation operations.

## How to create your own plugin

To create your own plugin, please refer to the documentation available in the [Plugin section](https://developers.ledger.com/docs/device-app/explanation/device-app-role) of the Developer Portal.

Here is the overall process:
1. Plugin development is done by your team.
2. Once the plugin is developed, an external security lab conducts the plugin security audit (you must contact the auditor yourself).
3. You submit the Audit security report to Ledger. 
4. Ledger will then perform a review and complete the final validation before releasing the plugin in production.

Note: a plugin can be developed for EVM-compatible blockchains, as it works in tandem with the Ethereum App installed on Ledger devices. If your LiveApp allows staking on non-EVM blockchains, please reach out to the Ledger team for assistance with this process.
