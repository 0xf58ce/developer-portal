# What do we need

In order to become a native Card provider in the Ledger Live ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Exchange SDK in addition to the Ledger Live Kit.
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API endpoint to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Send your public key to Ledger and secure your private key.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Ledger Live Kit doc](https://wallet.api.live.ledger.com/docs/discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:
  - Your API, 
  - Your LiveApp Manifest,
  - Your public key.

</Steps>

In the following pages, you will find:
- [LiveApp](card/providers-liveapp): Details about your LiveApp, such as the LiveApp URL, the Manifest, or the use of the Exchange SDK alongside the Ledger Live Kit.
- [Backend](card/providers-backend): Details on the main endpoint required, including the payload, the signature, and your public/private key.
- [Test & Submit](card/providers-test-and-submit): Details on how to use the Ledger Live Developer Mode and other tools (coming soon) to test your integration end-to-end, as well as how to submit it.
