title: ASA tokens
description: For ASAs, compared to ERC20, the process differs due to the fact that the tokens details are hardcoded within the Algorand embedded application instead of being streamed to the device.

# ASA token addition request

For ASA tokens, the addition process is not entirely automatic. A modification of the Algorand application is required.

## 1. How do the ASA tokens get listed?

Tokens are added automatically to the supported crypto-assets list a few times a week. If ater a two weeks period you don't see the token on the [crypto-assets list](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets), please contact [the customer service team](https://support.ledger.com/contact-us).

## 2. How can they be handled on Ledger devices?

Update the [Algorand embedded app](https://github.com/algorand/ledger-app-algorand/blob/main/app/src/algo_asa.c).
When your PR is validated by the Algorand team, they will make a PR to Ledger Github repository.
