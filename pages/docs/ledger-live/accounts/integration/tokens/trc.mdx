# TRC10 and TRC20 token addition request

For TRC tokens, the addition process is not entirely automatic. A modification of the Tron application is required.

## 1. How do the TRC10 and TRC20 tokens get listed?

Tokens are added automatically to the supported crypto-assets list a few times a week. If ater a two weeks period you don't see the token on the [crypto-assets list](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets), please contact [the customer service team](https://support.ledger.com/contact-us).

## 2. How can they be handled on Ledger devices?

|     TRC10       |     TRC20     |
|-----------------|---------------|
| A specific signature is required on the [Tron Embedded App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-tron). | Update both `src/tokens.c` and `src/tokens.h` in the [Tron Embedded App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-tron). |
