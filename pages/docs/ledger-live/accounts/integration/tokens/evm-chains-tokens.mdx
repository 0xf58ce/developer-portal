# ERC-20 token addition request

For ERC-20 tokens, the addition process is almost entirely automatic. You may have to add the icon to the Ethereum application. 

## 1. How do the ERC-20 tokens get listed?

Tokens are added automatically to the supported crypto-assets list a few times a week. If ater a two weeks period you don't see the token on the [crypto-assets list](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets), please contact [the customer service team](https://support.ledger.com/contact-us).

## 2. How can they be handled on Ledger devices?

The support of ERC-20 token on Ledger devices is already handled by the Ethereum aplication.

## 3. How to add a token icon?

When a Token is added in Ledger Live without an icon, it will display the first letter of the token's name. To add an icon, you must open a Pull Request in the Ledger Live repository. You can [check this PR](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/5394) for an example, to update [the package](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ui/packages/crypto-icons).

You can either create the icon or find it on [cryptoicons.co](http://cryptoicons.co/) or [cryptologos.cc](https://cryptologos.cc/).

Some rules about the icon:
- Don't use Linear gradients, defs, masks, clip-path, filters and inline styles
- Only use svg, path, circle, ellipse, rect, polyline, line tags if needed and add fill="black"

Feel free to look at the other icons to see what is expected.
