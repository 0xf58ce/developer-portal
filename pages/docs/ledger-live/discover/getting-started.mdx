# Adding a Live App to the Discover section

## Integration process

The integration of an app in the Discover section of Ledger is done on an invitation only basis.

## Pathways to integration: dAppBrowser vs. Ledger Services Kit

There are two options when it comes to integrating into Ledger Live

- **The dAppBrowser (EVM Only for now)**

This one is only available to EVM based dApps for now. By crafting a manifest, directing it to the dAppBrowser, and incorporating the Iframe Provider in their app, developers can quickly add their application to Ledger Live.

- **the Ledger Services Kit**

The Ledger Services Kit pathway is more code-intensive, requiring a deeper engagement from developers. However, it grants a more granular control over the core wallet features within Ledger Live. A thorough understanding of the Ledger Services Kit can be gleaned from the official documentation.

		<iframe title="Live App Structure" frameBorder="0" style={{position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%"}} src="https://view.genial.ly/65241621e3a92300127e47e8" type="text/html" allowscriptaccess="always" allowFullScreen={true} scrolling="yes" allownetworking="all"></iframe> 
	</div> 
</div>

The path you chose is yours to decide, we'll provide you guidelines for both roads in the how-to guides.
