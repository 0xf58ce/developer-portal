# Adding a Live App to the Discover section

## Integration process

The integration of an app in the Discover section of Ledger is done on an invitation only basis.

## Pathways to integration: dAppBrowser vs. Wallet API

There are two options when it comes to integrating into Ledger Live

- **The dAppBrowser (EVM Only for now)**

This one is only available to EVM based dApps for now. By crafting a manifest, directing it to the dAppBrowser, and incorporating the Iframe Provider in their app, developers can quickly add their application to Ledger Live.

- **The Wallet API**

The Wallet API pathway is more code-intensive, requiring a deeper engagement from developers. However, it grants a more granular control over the core wallet features within Ledger Live. A thorough understanding of the Wallet API can be gleaned from the official documentation.

The path you chose is yours to decide, we'll provide you guidelines for both roads.
