# Load a dApp in Ledger Live Discover

## Write and load the manifest

To test and integrate the application, you first need to write your application Manifest file.
This file must contain some mandatory information, such as the app package names, the components, the permissions needed, the hardware and software features, etc.

```json copy
{
  "id": "lido",
  "name": "Lido",
  "url": "https://stake.lido.fi/?embed=true",

## Load your Live App locally on desktop

To load your Live App locally, [unlock the Developer mode](../developer-mode/) in Ledger Live and [add a local app](../developer-mode#add-a-local-app).


This option will allow you to browse for local files and add a local app using a local manifest.
With it you can be autonomous in testing your application.
Youâ€™ll have to load your own manifest to make your application appear in the Discover section.


## Load your Live App locally on mobile (Android only)

Go to the **Settings** -> **Developer** section, and click on **Load Platform Manifest** you can copy your manifest here and load it.
