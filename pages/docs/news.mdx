# What to expect in the beginning of 2025?

## Clear signing visualization and Json generation tool

Ledger will launch a tool that not only allow developers to visualize clear signing operations as they would appear on Ledger devices but also facilitate the generation of JSON metadata according to the ERC-7730 standard.

This development aligns with Ledger's ongoing commitment to enhancing the transparency and security of dApp interactions on EVM chains. 

The tool will enable developers to simulate and preview how clear signing information is displayed on Ledger Flex, ensuring their smart contracts provide end-users with comprehensible transactional data. Such previews are essential for debugging and optimizing user interfaces before launching on the Ledger ecosystem.

Moreover, the tool provides a streamlined workflow for generating and validating JSON metadata files. By reflecting actual smart contract operations, developers can ensure compliance with the ERC-7730 specifications, resulting in smoother submissions to the registry and broader accessibility once integrated with the Ledger generic parser.

To maximize the utility of this tool, developers can follow these essential steps:

## The DMK continues to evolve

Exciting developments are on the horizon for developers working with Ledger devices as the Ledger Device Management Kit (DMK) undergoes significant improvements. 

This kit, designed to supersede the existing LedgerJS Transport libraries, offers a fresh and streamlined approach to managing Ledger devices, promising enhanced functionality and integration capabilities.

In its current early development phase, the DMK project is set to revolutionize the way developers interact with Ledger devices. Ledger invites developers to explore the new possibilities presented by the DMK and get hands-on with tools and boilerplates aimed at easing the transition. By engaging with these resources and the broader community, developers can help steer the DMK project towards a fully stable and robust release, ensuring a cutting-edge experience for all Ledger device users.

## Where to meet us?

The Ledger Dev Rel team will be at ETH Oxford and ETH Denver!

**February 7-9th, 2025**
Come meet the team at ETH Oxford, hosted at the world-renowned Oxford Mathematics Institute. This is a great opportunity to learn about building the future of blockchain, surrounded by history.

**February 23rd to March 2nd**
The team will also be at ETH Denver, the worldâ€™s largest and longest-running Ethereum #BUIDLathon event, in Denver, Colorado.
We are excited to meet all of you and discuss the latest developments in clear signing with ERC-7730, which makes signing transactions on Ledger devices more user-friendly.

At both events, you can:

- Discover the Clear Signing initiative and why it's necessary for the ecosystem
- Learn how to enable Clear Signing in your projects

We look forward to meeting you there!
