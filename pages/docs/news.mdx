# November 2024 - Introducing New Dev Kits 

We're excited to launch three new development kits as part of the Ledger SDK Galaxy. These kits allow seamless connection to Ledger devices and interaction with installed apps: the Device Management Kit, the Device Signer Kit, and the Context Module.

## Enhanced Developer Experience

Previously, integrating with our devices required multiple JavaScript libraries used by Ledger Live, which lacked comprehensive handling of edge cases. This often necessitated additional development effort.

## Comprehensive Solutions

- **Device Management Kit**: Streamlines device interaction by managing connections, session states, and supporting USB and BLE for various Ledger models, including the Nano S Plus, Nano X, and Ledger Flex.

- **Device Signer Kit**: Offers interfaces for handling signer operations such as address retrieval and transaction signing, directly connecting with device apps.

- **Context Module**: Provides metadata to device apps and introduces full support for Clear Signing, ensuring understandable and transparent signing processes.

## Open Source and Interactive

All of this technology is open source, and we encourage you to explore the code. Feedback is welcome! Try our sample app to experience these innovations firsthand: [Sample App](https://app.devicesdk.ledger-test.com).
