# How the submission of an app goes?

## Release flow

This process is applicable to first submissions and to App updates.

## Release types

There are different release types for an application:

-   **Developer mode release**
-   **Public release** (official Ledger support)

An application can go through Ledger acceptance several times, according to release type.


<Callout type="info" emoji="👉">
  Until the application is audited, the message <code>Pending Ledger Review</code> is displayed when the application is used. The user must acknowledge this warning by pressing both buttons to use the application, which is at their own risk.
</Callout>

Developer mode applications are considered experimental and such application will be visible **only when the [developer mode](../../../docs/discover/developer-mode) setting is enabled** in Ledger Live settings.

<Callout type="info" emoji="👉">
  Some applications are only visible if developer mode is enabled because they are considered too complex to use, not because they lack a security review. For example, the mandatory compatible wallet may be missing a GUI, or perhaps the application is considered too technical for the majority of users.
</Callout>

## App submission

### Ready to submit your App for review?

The submission of a Ledger embedded app is completed through a form. This will ask you for all the various items required together in one place (some of them listed in the [requirements](./requirements)).

Once you have finished your work and you have collected all the App items you must enter them in the [submission form](./submission-form).

Make sure you thoroughly complete the form to ensure a speedy release process.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
	The integration process will only start if you answer accurately to all the questions.
</Callout>


## App updates

Here, you have already submitted an embedded app and you want to update for your community.

Since Ledger will not update your embedded app code, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release.

Application updates must be submitted alongside:
- functional tests, and
- a  [Security Audit](./requirements/security#security-audit)

Afterwards you will submit a new form where you can pick and choose the parts of the App that have been updated.

The form must be submitted for all types of releases (developer mode and public releases).

Please [fill in this form](./submission-form) for any updates to your embedded app code.

To have your application updates released on time, we recommend you inform Ledger as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.

Looking forward to see your updates on "My Ledger" in Ledger Live!
