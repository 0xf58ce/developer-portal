## What to do?

### 1. Read the requirements

For an app to be deploy, it must comply with a list of requirements, which are expressed in [this section](./deliver/requirements).

### 2. Build & Load and use the Ledger framework

If you want to build your application yourself, refer to this [chapter](./develop).

Else, you can found [here](./deliver/references) a list of developer companies which are used to working with us.


### 3. Submit your App

Use and submit the [submission form](./deliver/submission-form) to complete the process.

### 4. Finished!

We will contact you via Discord to let you know how your submission is doing.

## Get in touch with the Ledger developer community

Joining Discord is not required to code your Embedded Application, but it will be easier to meet with our team and discuss the specifics of your project. Join us on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) and introduce your project in the **#dev-support** channel.
