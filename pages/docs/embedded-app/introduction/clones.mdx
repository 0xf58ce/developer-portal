# Clone Applications

## What is a clone?

A variant, or clone, embedded app is developed when all the logic for signing transactions can be contained in the parent coin Embedded Application.

As for any Embedded Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply with Ledger publication requirements.


## Which development process for your Ethereum clone?

### Using the 44/60 path

**Prerequisites**

Follow this process if your chain uses the 44/60 path.

**Start here**

Instead of building your own application, you will clone and modify the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum).

- Fork the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum)
- Before committing your changes remember to sign your commits.
- Please make your changes to the `develop` branch

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For security reasons, the repository is set up to accept only pull requests with signed commits. To sign your commits, use the -S flag : <code>$ git commit -S -m your commit message</code>
</Callout>

#### Modify app-ethereum/src_common/network.c

Add your chain ID, chain name and Ticker to [network.c](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/blob/develop/src_common/network.c) following this example:

```js copy
{.chain_id = 592, .name = "Astar", .ticker = "ASTR"},
```

#### Add an icon for Ledger Stax

Add your 64x64px gif icon in the `glyphs` folder following this naming convention: `stax_yourchainid_64px.gif`.
Use the template provided [here](../deliver/requirements/deliverables/icons#stax-template).

#### Add your Network to Chainlist.org and SLIP-0044

- Chainlist.org: Click "Add Your Network +" on [the Chainlist homepage](https://chainlist.org/) and follow the ReadMe to add your Network.

- SLIP-0044: Open a PR to add your network [in this file](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)

#### Open a pull request

When your application is ready, open a pull request on the Ethereum application repository.

Please get in touch with our team on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to get your PR reviewed.


### All other paths

Follow this process if your chain uses another path than 44/60.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If your chain does not use the `44/60` path, you won't be able to use Metamask with your embedded app.
</Callout>

#### Start here

Instead of building your application in a separate repository, you will make changes to the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum).

- Fork the [Ethereum app](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum)
- Before committing your changes remember to sign your commits.
- Please make your changes to the `develop` branch

The following page uses the Walton Chain as an example, please replace every `WaltonChain` occurence with the name of your coin and chain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For security reasons, the repository is set up to accept only pull requests with signed commits. To sign your commits, use the -S flag : <code>$ git commit -S -m your commit message</code>
</Callout>

#### Create a file in app-ethereum/makefile_conf/chain

Following the next example, add a `.mk` file in `app-ethereum/makefile_conf/chain`

``` c copy
APP_LOAD_PARAMS += --path "44'/999999'"
TICKER = "WTC"
CHAIN_ID = 15
APPNAME = "WaltonChain"
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    It is necessary to choose a Derivation Path and a Chain ID specific to your network to prevent the risk of replay attack (Introduced by EIP155) that can happen when using the same Derivation Path ( m/44'/60'/0') and Chain ID as Ethereum. This could expose your users to loss of funds.<br/>
    You can either use the same Derivation Path but define a new chain ID (make sure this is not used by another network) or use slip44/BIP44 standard to reserve a dedicated coin type that will allow you to define a new derivation path.
</Callout>

#### Upload your app's icons

- Add your 16x16px Nanos , 14x14px Nano S Plus / Nano X and 32x32 Stax gif icons in the `icons` folder following these naming conventions: `nanos_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`, `nanox_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`, `stax_app_chain_yourchainid.gif`
- Add your 64x64px gif icon in the `icons` folder following this naming convention: `stax_yourchainid_64px.gif`.
Use the template provided [here](../deliver/requirements/deliverables/icons#stax-template).

##### Build the application

To build the clone application, [follow this guide](../develop/tutorials/quickstart).
1. First run the `make` command for the Ethereum App and run `make load`
2. Run `make clean`
2. Load the Embedded App clone with the name of your chain. E.g: `make load CHAIN=tomochain`

#### Add your Network to Chainlist.org and SLIP-0044

- Chainlist.org: Click "Add Your Network +" on [the Chainlist homepage](https://chainlist.org/) and follow the ReadMe to add your Network.

- SLIP-0044: Open a PR to add your network [in this file](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md)

#### Open a pull request

When your application is ready, open a pull request on the Ethereum application repository.

Please get in touch with our team on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to get your PR reviewed.


## What if my coin is a Bitcoin clone?

### New Bitcoin clone

For any other clone type, use the [main Embedded App process](../deliver/process).

### Update an existing clone

If your Bitcoin clone was included in the Bitcoin Embedded App and you need to update it, please start a [new Embedded App process](../deliver/process).


## What to do?

### 1. Read the coding guidelines

You don't need to follow all the coding guidelines. Only follow the steps below:

|                                                                      | Eth Clones |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------:|
| [Blind Signing](../deliver/requirements/design#blind-signing)        | Depends    |
| [Icon](../deliver/requirements/deliverables/icons/)                  | **Yes**    |
| [Documentation](../deliver/requirements/deliverables/documentation/) | Depends    |
| [Functional Tests](../deliver/requirements/development)              | **Yes**    |
| [Warranty / Liability acceptance](../deliver/requirements/legal)     | **Yes**    |


### 2. Build & Load and use the Ledger framework

Refer to this [chapter](../develop).


### 3. Submit your App

Refer to this [chapter](../deliver).


### 4. Finished!

We will contact you via Discord to let you know how your submission is doing.


## Get in touch with the Ledger developer community

Joining Discord is not required to code your Embedded Application, but it will be easier to meet with our team and discuss the specifics of your project. Join us on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) and introduce your project in the **#dev-support** channel.
