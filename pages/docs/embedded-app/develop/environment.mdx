# Embedded environment


## Docker images

As the embedded applications needs to run on a non-standard system, and thus need specific build chain and
configuration, we provide `Docker` images so that building an app and loading it on a device has a minimal
impact on one's computer - given `Docker` is installed.

Several images are available depending on the developer's needs.

<Callout type="info">
    These images are maintained and update on [this repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/).
</Callout>


## VScode extension

The `VSCode` extension uses the most complete Docker image we provide and wires it into the `VScode` IDE for a
frictionless development experience.

It includes the following capabilities:

- Build the embedded application for all existing devices
- Test the app with `Speculos`
- Load an app on your device
- Execute functional tests
- Open a terminal in your Docker container
- Update the development environment

<Callout type="info">
    The extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools),
    while the sources are updated [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-vscode-extension).
</Callout>


## GitHub Workflows

Ledger provides several workflows to ease the integration of applications into the GitHub CI.

[Some of them are mandatory for an application to be deployed](../deliver/requirements/development#workflows), but
the others can still be useful.

<Callout type="info">
    Documentation and sources can be found [here](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows).<br/>
    Usage examples can be found in the CI of lots of applications, for instance the
    [Boilerplate workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/workflows), the
    [Ethereum workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/tree/develop/.github/workflows) or the
    [Exchange workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-exchange/tree/develop/.github/workflows).
</Callout>


## Application repository flow

To be able to deploy an application (and sometimes test or apply modifications), Ledger will fork the application's
repository.

Our fork will have its own Git flow, which will help us keep track of what code is deployed in production or not,
through branches and tags.

Basically, all of the work and PR is made into or against a `develop` branch. Ledger will also deploy application
from develop to specific, test providers (number 4 except for Stax application which usually are deployed on 12).

This application will not be available for most Ledger Live users which use the default, production provider (number 1),
but it is available for anyone changing the provider number ("Settings > Experimental features > My Ledger provider"),
so that it allows real-life testing and qualification.

Further fixes or modification before the application is deemed ready will be merged from the developer's repository into
this `develop` branch.
