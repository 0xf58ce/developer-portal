# The `Rust` boilerplate application

<Callout type="warning">
  This section is still a Work In Progress, as the `Rust` SDK is not yet stable and fully integrated in our
  production environment.
</Callout>

The `Rust` Boilerplate application is taylored to showcase both the capabilities of the Ledger Secure `Rust` SDK and our
development environment and tools.

By cloning this application, you should find extensive examples on how to managed APDU communication, declare UI flows,
use cryptographic APIs, but also how to integrate into our build and test environment, and how to deploy your
application.

With very little changes, you should be able to quickly have an application of your own.
