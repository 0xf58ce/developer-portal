# Get a project going and start experimenting

To get your project started quickly, we provide a complete framework made to develop embedded application for our
devices. This framework works on Linux, Mac and Windows. It contains:

- An [OS emulator called `Speculos`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos)
- A [test framework called `Ragger`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ragger), using `Speculos`
- [CI workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/)
- [`Docker` containers](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/) providing up-to-date development environments
- A [Visual Studio Code extension (ledger-dev-tools)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
  packaging the previous tools altogether inside the VSCode IDE
- Several boilerplate applications, to be used as a modifyable bases to create your own application:
  - [A `C` Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)
  - [A `Rust` Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate-rust) and
  - [A Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-pluginboilerplate)

More information on these components can be found in the [tutorials](./tutorials), [environment](./environment)
and [tools](./tools) sections.


## Build & load an application


### Prerequisites

- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
- An X11 server
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [The Ledger extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
- The (`C`) [Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)


### How-to

1. Ensure `Docker` is running
2. Install the [Visual Studio Code Ledger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
2. In VSCode, open the [Boilerplate application](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)
3. Use VSCode Ledger extension's sidebar menu or open the tasks menu with `ctrl + shift + b` (`command + shift + b` on a
   Mac) to conveniently execute actions:
     - To pull and run the Docker image chose `Run dev-tools image`
     - To build your app chose `Build app`
    -  To load it to a device, chose `Load app on device`

From there, you should have the capability to fully build, load and test an application. [Make changes in Boilerplate](./tutorials/c)
to customize it to your liking!
