# Get a project going or just start experimenting

To get your project quickly started, we provide a complete framework made for developing Embedded Apps for our devices. This Framework contains:

- An App Boilerplate
- The Ledger Visual Studio Code extension
- CI workflows
- A test framework called Ragger, that uses Speculos
- An OS simulator called Speculos

This framework works on Linux, Mac and Windows and will speed up your Embedded Apps development process and submission process.

# The Ledger Framework

## Your project port of entry: the App Boilerplate

An App Boilerplate to test our Framework and to kickstart your Embedded App project for Nano S Plus, Nano X and Ledger Stax. See how to build it and load it on a device [in this section](./build-load).

[Click here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate) to fork the repository and start your project.

## Ledger Visual Studio Code Extension

The Ledger Visual Studio Extension leverages our Docker image, the app dev tool, so that it is always up to date with the latest standards and dependences. It contains the toolchain and the complete test framework (Speculos + Ragger).

It includes the following actions:

- Build the Embedded App for all devices
- Load an App on your device
- Execute functional tests
- Test the App with Speculos
- Open a terminal in your docker container
- Clean build files
- Update container

See how to use them [in this section](./build-load).


## CI

In the App Boilerplate you will find [a list of workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/workflows) to set up an efficient CI pipeline for your project.

Two of these workflows are a requirement to submit your embedded application:
- [Build_and_functional_tests](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml), which will build the app and run functional tests using the Ragger framework upon Speculos emulation
- [Guidelines_enforcer](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml), which calls a reusable workflow guidelines_enforcer developed by Ledger's internal developer team


## Ragger

A Python framework which aims at simplifying the test and overall automatic manipulation of applications running on Ledger devices. It is used by the App Boilerplate's CI. You can read the full Ragger documentation [here](https://ledgerhq.github.io/ragger/).

## Speculos

A Ledger device simulator. It is used by the App Boilerplate's CI. You can read the full Speculos documentation [here](https://speculos.ledger.com/).

# Build & Load App

With the [Ledger Framework](./framework), you can build and load Embedded Apps on Linux, Mac and Windows, very easily, with the Visual Code Ledger extension.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- An X11 server
- Visual Studio Code
- [The Ledger extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)


## How-to build and load

1. Have Docker running. Note: Not needed on Linux because this is already a background task.
2. Open the [Boilerplate App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate) or your own App in Visual Studio Code
3. Use Ledger extension's sidebar menu or open the tasks menu with `ctrl + shift + b` (`command + shift + b` on a Mac) to conveniently execute actions:
	- To pull and run the Docker image chose `Run dev-tools image`
	- To build your app chose `Build app`
	- To load it to a device, chose `Load app on device`


For more information, or if you want to manually Build and Load your app, read the [Boilerplate App documentation](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

## Actions flow

The other actions are described in the [Boilerplate App repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate).

Here is the usual flow for using theses actions:
