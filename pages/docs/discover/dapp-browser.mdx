# How to add a dApp with the dApp Browser v3 ?

To integrate a dApp with the dApp Browser, you need to:

- Read the [submission guidelines](./guidelines)
- Update [your dApp](./dapp-browser/dapp-customisation/)
- Write a [manifest](./dapp-browser/manifest/)
- Create a [dApp Plugin](./dapp-browser/plugin/)

# Already using the dApp Browser ?

We are in the process of deprecating the dApp Browser live-app v1 and v2.

Ledger Live will now support injecting a compatible provider in the webview.

You can follow our [migration documentation](./dapp-browser/migration/) to update your dApp
