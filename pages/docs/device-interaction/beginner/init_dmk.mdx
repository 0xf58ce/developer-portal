# Setting up the SDK

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up the Device Management Kit (DMK) SDK in your application. We'll guide you through initializing the SDK using the `DeviceSdkBuilder` and setting up logging. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a singleton instance of the SDK that will serve as the entry point for all interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A working development environment with Node.js installed.
- Access to the DMK package (@ledgerhq/device-management-kit) in your project.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Import Required Components

Start by importing the necessary components from the DMK package. You'll need `ConsoleLogger`, `DeviceSdk`, and `DeviceSdkBuilder`.

```ts
import {
  ConsoleLogger,
  DeviceSdk,
  DeviceSdkBuilder,
} from "@ledgerhq/device-management-kit";
```

### Step 2: Initialize the SDK with Configuration

Use the `DeviceSdkBuilder` to initialize the SDK. You can configure it by adding one or more custom loggers. In this example, we'll add a `ConsoleLogger`.

```ts
const sdk = new DeviceSdkBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .build();
```

### Step 3: Maintain a Singleton Instance

The SDK should be instantiated only once during your application's runtime. It's important to keep the returned `DeviceSdk` object as a singleton. Store the reference globally if possible, so it can be reused across your application.

```ts
export const sdk = new DeviceSdkBuilder()
  .addLogger(new ConsoleLogger())
  .build();
```

## Best Practices

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensure the SDK instance is maintained as a singleton. This improves efficiency and prevents repeated initializations.
