# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find all the documentation related to the device management kit and all the signers coming along with it.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This project is currently in the early stages of development. We may introduce breaking changes to the Libraries.
  
  Your feedback is invaluable and will help us stabilize the project. Please reach out to us on the [Ledger Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to share your thoughts. 
  
  Follow our [migration guidelines](./integration/migration/intro) for seamless updates.

The Device Management Kit is set to supersede the LedgerJS Transport libraries. We recommend using the new DMK for all new projects. Although you can still access the previous LedgerJS documentation [here](./ledgerjs/info), consider updating your existing integrations.

To learn about the differences between LDMK and LedgerJS Transport libraries, see [this documentation](./explanation/ledgerjs).

Explore the features of the Device Management Kit in the [References section](./references/dmk).

## Glossary

We use the following acronyms throughout the documentation:
- DMK: Device Management Kit
- DSK: Device Signer Kit


## Tools and boilerplates

- To familiarize yourself with our transport libraries and tools, start with our beginner guides.
- Begin developing your project by visiting the integration walkthroughs and selecting your platform.

## Libraries

Below is a summary of the libraries included in the DMK:

## Setup

### Description

The Device Management Kit package provides a straightforward interface for handling Ledger devices. It includes essential entry points, classes, types, structures, and models.

### Installation

Install the DMK package with the following command:

```sh
npm install @ledgerhq/device-management-kit
```

### Usage

#### Compatibility

This library is compatible with [browsers supporting the WebHID API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API#browser_compatibility).

#### Pre-requisites
