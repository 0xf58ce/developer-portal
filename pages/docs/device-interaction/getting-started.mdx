# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find the all the documention related to the device management kit and all the signers coming along with it.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This project is still in early development so we allow ourselves to make
  breaking changes regarding the usage of the Libraries.

That's why any feedback is relevant for us in order to be able to make it stable as soon as
possible. Get in touch with us on the [Ledger Discord
server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) to provide your feedbacks.

You can follow the migration guidelines [here](./integration/migration/intro)

</Callout>

The Device Management Kit will replace the LedgerJS Transport libraries in the future. For any new project, we recommend you use the new Device Management Kit.

For existing projects, you can still access the LedgerJS documentation in [this  section](./ledgerjs/info) but we recommend that you consider updating your integration.

To understand the differences between the LDMK and LedgerJS Transport libraries, read [this documentation](./explanation/ledgerjs).

The Device Management Kit features are listed [in the References section](./references/dmk).

## Glossary

Throughout all the documentation we will use several acronyms that you can find the following description :

- DMK: Device Management Kit
- DSK: Device Signer Kit


## Tools and boilerplates

- To play with our transport librairies and get fimiliar with our tools, we recommend you go through our beginners' guides. 
- To start developing your project go to the integration walkthroughs and pick your platform.

## Libraries

Here you can found a summary of all the libraries that are composing the DMK

## Setup

### Description

This package contains the core of the Device Management Kit. It provides a simple interface to handle Ledger devices and features the Device Management Kit's entry points, classes, types, structures, and models.

### Installation

To install the dmk package, run the following command:

```sh
npm install @ledgerhq/device-management-kit
```

### Usage

#### Compatibility

This library works in [any browser supporting the WebHID API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API#browser_compatibility).

#### Pre-requisites
