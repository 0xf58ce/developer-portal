# Get your exchange services in Ledger Live

As a centralized exchange, it is possible to integrate your Swap/Sell/Buy/Fund services into Ledger Live as a native function of Ledger Live, thus offering security, ease and accessibility to millions of users!

With this integration, your services will appear directly under the corresponding section (Buy/Sell, Swap, Card) of Ledger Live.

To see if this integration is a good fit for your service, please get in touch with Ledger beforehand.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There are two types of integration:
  - Light autonomous first step integration: your LiveApp is accessible through the “Discover” section (like [Paraswap](https://www.ledger.com/blog/more-swapping-freedom-access-paraswap-directly-through-ledger-live)). For this integration, refer to the [Discover](/docs/discover) section instead.  
  - Main flow: your LiveApp can be integrated natively to Ledger Live. Better exposition but with additional API integration. More details in this section.
