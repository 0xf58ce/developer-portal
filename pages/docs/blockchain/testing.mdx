# Writing Tests

## Introduction

The technical description of the bot in the Ledger Live repo, [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/wiki/LLC:bot).  

The only tests needed are "Send 50%" and "Send max". Together these cover all the functions required, as seen [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/wiki/LLC:bot#test-expectations).  The two tests are in the code below.  

## Setting up the Test Toolchain

Before testing, make sure you have [set up the CLI](./setup-build/ledger-live-cli/).
