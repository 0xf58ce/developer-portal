# How to develop an application

This chapter contains pratical tutorials, leads on our environment tools, boilerplates, and code-level explanations on
the SDK.

Whereas the ["How to deploy an app"](./deliver) was intended to be focused on mandatory subjects with little
further specificaction, you should find in this one more detailed information (or links to detailed information) and
explanations.

## What the framework contains

To get your project started quickly, we provide a complete framework made to develop device applications. This framework works on Linux, Mac and Windows. It contains:

- An [OS emulator called `Speculos`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos)
- A [test framework called `Ragger`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ragger), using `Speculos`
- [CI workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/)
- [`Docker` containers](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/) providing up-to-date development environments
- A [Visual Studio Code extension (ledger-dev-tools)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
  packaging the previous tools altogether inside the VSCode IDE
- Several boilerplate applications, to be used as a modifyable bases to create your own application:
  - [A `C` Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)
  - [A `Rust` Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate-rust) and
  - [A Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-plugin-boilerplate)

More information on these components can be found in the [tutorials](./tutorials), [development environment](./tutorials)
and [tools](./tools) sections.
