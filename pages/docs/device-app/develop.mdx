# How to develop an application

This chapter contains pratical tutorials, leads on our environment tools, boilerplates, and code-level explanations on
the SDK.

Whereas the ["Deliver"](./deliver) chapter was intended to be focused on mandatory subjects with little
further specification, you should find in this one more detailed information (or links to detailed information) and
explanations.
