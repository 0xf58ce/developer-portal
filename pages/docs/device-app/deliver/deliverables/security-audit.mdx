# Security Audit

## Introduction

To be listed on the Ledger Live “My Ledger“ section, Device Apps and Plugins must go through our integration process that includes a security audit performed by one of our trusted partners.

Provided your project fulfills the [conditions](#conditions), this is how an external audit unfolds:
1. You get in touch with the auditers and sign a contract with them. [Read more](../partners#security-audit-your-agreement-with-our-partners).
2. The auditors review your app based on Ledger specifications. [Read more](#content-of-the-security-audit).
3. Ledger reviews the security audit report
4. Ledger publishes your app

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The security audit is mandatory for an application to be available on our production providers (accessible by
    default from the LedgerLive). However it is possible to deploy without security audit on other providers, for test
    purposes. However, the application [will need to display a warning message when starting](../process#release-types).

    <ul>
        <li>Do not start a security audit process if your Device App is not ready for all Ledger devices (Ledger Nano S, S Plus, X and Stax).</li>
        <li>Your Device App must still be functional after the security audit </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>


## Conditions

To go through an external security audit, ensure your project fulfills the following conditions:

- Your Device App works with all our devices (Ledger Nano S, S Plus, X and Stax)
- Your Device App has been functionally validated by Ledger team

## Content of the security audit

Ledger has established and made public a detailed specification of what needs to be done to perform a security audit following Ledger’s standards.

|          Step          |         Specification                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application privileges | Check application flags (privileges) and allowed derivation paths. |
| Compilation            | Check for compilation warnings, and if warnings have been silenced. If so, ask for a fix. |
| Tests                  | Run tests and check they succeed / Check tests are sound.           |
| Static Analysis        | Check for defects using scan-build and our scan options. Add in CI if not present / CodeQL: check with the "security and quality" queries. Add in CI if not present. |
| Manual code review     | List every transaction fields. Look which ones must be displayed to the user / Check transaction parser, field formatters / Check if sensitive data is properly erased / Do not allow blind signing. |
| Fuzzing                | Implement a transaction fuzzer. Best effort to reach decent coverage / Use libFuzzer if possible to integrate with ClusterFuzzLite. |
| Deliverables           | Report and executive summary detailing findings, and tests that gave no results / Security fixes: on a temporary private fork / Feedback on the SDK: what could be improved for a better security. |
