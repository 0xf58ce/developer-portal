# App maintenance

Here, you have already submitted an embedded app and you want to update for your community.

Since Ledger will not update your embedded app code, you are responsible for all subsequent updates following the initial release.

Application updates must be submitted alongside:
- functional tests, and
- a  [Security Audit](./requirements/security#security-audit)

Afterwards you will submit a new form where you can pick and choose the parts of the App that have been updated.

Please [fill in this form](./submission-form) for any updates to your device app code or [this one](https://ledger.typeform.com/to/YZZCHEB8) for an update of a plugin.

To have your application updates released on time, we recommend you inform Ledger as soon as possible and submit the changes at least one month before the desired release date.

Looking forward to see your updates on "My Ledger" in Ledger Live!
