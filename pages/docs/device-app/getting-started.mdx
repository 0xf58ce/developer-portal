# Getting started

In this section of the Developer Portal, you will find the resources to build, test and submit C device apps, Rust device apps, Ethereum plugins and Cloned coins apps. 

## Tools and boilerplates

- To learn how to quickstart a project the Ledger VS code extension, read [this guide](./beginner/vscode-extension). The extension makes the environment set up, the app building, and the tests very easy.
- To start developing your project with the boilerplates, go in the How-to section in "Integration walkthroughs" and you will find [the C Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/c-boilerplate), [the Rust Boilerplate](./integration/how-to/rust-boilerplate), [the Ethereum plugin doc](./integration/how-to/plugin) and [the Cloned coins apps integration process](./integration/how-to/clone).

## Development process and security audit

Before publication, an application must go through a functional and security review. We recommend you get in touch _____ before starting your development process.

To know more about the submission steps, read the [App deployment process documentation](./submission-process/process).

When your device app is ready to go through the security audit, you can contact one of our partners:

- [Kudelski IoT]( https://www.kudelski-iot.com/services-and-systems/ledger-security-audit).
- [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/), contact them [here](mailto:qb_ledger@quarkslab.com).

They both follow Ledger specifications and will provide a full report with potential vulnerabilites.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ensure your device app meets all necessary requirements and is fully tested before initiating a security audit with our partners
</Callout>

Important aspects of your agreement:
- Time: When the auditors will be able to start the review.
- Cost: The external audit will be entirely at your expense.
- Maintenance: You must include a clause for updates or sign a new contract for any major update. If you don't, your app will not be updated by Ledger and might be delisted from My Ledger apps store if it is breaking.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Ledger is not a stakeholder in the contract between you and our partners.
