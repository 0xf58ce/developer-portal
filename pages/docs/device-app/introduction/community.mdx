# Get in touch with the Ledger developer community

Joining Discord is not required to code your Embedded Application, but it will be easier to meet with our team and
discuss the specifics of your project.

Join us on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) and introduce your project in the
**#dev-support** channel.

The following channels might interest you:

- [dev-support](https://discord.com/channels/885256081289379850/1007621744732950590) is the place if you have
  a technical question for the devs. Don't forget the `Embedded app` flag if it's related with the application
  development
- [embedded-app-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/885256081289379850/907623554542080070) is the channel the
  embedded app developers use to communicate about SDK releases, Boilerplate evolutions, or anything which could impact
  our development environment or tools.
- [rust-sdk](https://discord.com/channels/885256081289379850/912241185677000704) is a channel dedicated to the
  applications using the WIP Rust SDK.
