# Clone Applications

## What is a clone?

A clone is developed when all the logic for signing transactions can be contained in the parent coin Device Application.

As for any Device Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply with Ledger publication requirements.


## What to do?

You don't need to follow all the coding guidelines. Only follow the steps below:
