# Development


## Introduction

Developing applications for Ledger devices is an intricate process. The security of the user funds relies on the fact that the application works in a correct and secure manner and that potential attackers cannot misuse it to extract private data and/or sign requests which are not authorized by the user. The app should guard against such attacks because they have a very low entry point -- a Ledger device attached to a compromised host might be a victim of the attacker's program sending invalid/non-standard requests to the device.

  This guide is meant to be a summary of all important aspects of Ledger Apps security and it shall be read by developers before developing an app for Ledger.

## Workflows

Ledger provides [reusable workflows running on GitHub actions](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows), which
builds, analyzes or tests the code, checks the application's metadata and more. Some of these workflows are mandatory.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    <ul>
        <li>
            The following workflows are required on every device app repository, and must run without error.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ledger will not deploy an application if these workflows are not integrated and green.
        </li>
    </ul>
</Callout>


- The [guidelines enforcer workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_guidelines_enforcer.yml)
  (example its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/guidelines_enforcer.yml))
- The [build workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_build.yml)
  (example of its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml#L21-L25))


## Manifest

Some high-level application metadata must be declared in a `ledger_app.toml` manifest file, stored at the root of the
application repository.

The format of this manifest is described [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgered/blob/master/doc/utils/manifest.md),
along with the tool which can be used to check the validity of the manifest.
You can also use [the manifest in Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/ledger_app.toml)
as a living example

Most of our workflows (including the mandatory ones) use this manifest to infer environment data (like the SDK language,
or the build directory) so the validity of the manifest can be checked through these.

    Ledger will not deploy an application without a correct `ledger_app.toml` manifest.
</Callout>


## Tests

The application repository must have a `tests` folder that contains at least functional tests using the
[Speculos](../../develop/tools#speculos) emulator. These tests must be triggered by the CI and running without error.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Ledger will not deploy an application without tests or with failing tests.
</Callout>

For Python tests, Ledger provides the [`Ragger` library](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ragger), which can be easily
integrated with `Pytest` in the GitHub action with the [Ragger workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/reusable_ragger_tests.yml)
(example of its usage on boilerplate [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_functional_tests.yml#L27-L32))

Unit tests are highly recommended, especially for critical functions like parsers - preferably relying on a standard framework like [cmocka](https://cmocka.org/). These tests must be automated using GitHub actions the [unit tests workflow](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/blob/master/.github/workflows/unit_tests.yml) of the Boilerplate application can act as a reference.


## Nice to have

On top of that, we also encourage the following practices:

- Linting helps improving code quality and ensuring consistent coding style and resolving basic coding errors.
- Developing a fuzzer thanks to [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).
- Integration with the Coverity static code analysis tool helps finding security issues and software defects.
