# Get a project going and start experimenting

## Build & load an application

### Prerequisites

- [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
- An X server
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [The Ledger extension in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
- The (`C`) [Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)


### How-to

1. Ensure `Docker` is running
2. Install the [Visual Studio Code Ledger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools)
2. In VSCode, open the [Boilerplate application](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate)
3. Use VSCode Ledger extension's sidebar menu or open the tasks menu with `ctrl + shift + b` (`command + shift + b` on a
   Mac) to conveniently execute actions:
     - To pull and run the Docker image chose `Run dev-tools image`
     - To build your app chose `Build app`
    -  To load it to a device, chose `Load app on device`

From there, you should have the capability to fully build, load and test an application. [Make changes in Boilerplate](./c)
to customize it to your liking!
