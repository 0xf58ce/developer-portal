# Embedded environment


## Docker images

As the device applications needs to run on a non-standard system, and thus need specific build chain and
configuration, we provide `Docker` images so that building an app and loading it on a device has a minimal
impact on one's computer - given `Docker` is installed.

Several images are available depending on the developer's needs.

<Callout type="info">
    These images are maintained and update on [this repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-builder/).

## VScode extension

The `VSCode` extension uses the most complete Docker image we provide and wires it into the `VScode` IDE for a
frictionless development experience.

It includes the following capabilities:

- Build the device application for all existing devices
- Test the app with `Speculos`
- Load an app on your device
- Execute functional tests
- Open a terminal in your Docker container
- Update the development environment

<Callout type="info">
    The extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LedgerHQ.ledger-dev-tools),
    while the sources are updated [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-vscode-extension).

## GitHub Workflows

Ledger provides several workflows to ease the integration of applications into the GitHub CI.

[Some of them are mandatory for an application to be deployed](../develop/requirements/development#workflows), but
the others can still be useful.

<Callout type="info">
    Documentation and sources can be found [here](https://github.com/ledgerhq/ledger-app-workflows).<br/>
    Usage examples can be found in the CI of lots of applications, for instance the
    [Boilerplate workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-boilerplate/tree/master/.github/workflows), the
    [Ethereum workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-ethereum/tree/develop/.github/workflows) or the
    [Exchange workflows](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-exchange/tree/develop/.github/workflows).
