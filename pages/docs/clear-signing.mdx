# Enhancing Security through Clear Signing


## Why do your app need Clear Signing?

Blind signing is a significant vulnerability that scammers can exploit to steal funds from unsuspecting users. When only the transaction hash is displayed on the device, it becomes challenging for users to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the transaction they are signing.

At Ledger, we are committed to building a secure Web3 ecosystem. That's why we've introduced Clear Signing standards and metadata curation tools to combat this issue. These tools provide user-readable and understandable data, making it easier for users to identify potential risks and verify transactions accurately.

## How to implement Clear Signing?

In the following document and presentation, you will find comprehensive information to help you update your DApp or Wallet to support Clear Signing. By implementing clear signing for transfers, approvals, and permits, you can significantly enhance security and help educate users about potential risks.
