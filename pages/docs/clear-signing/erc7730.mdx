# ERC7730: the new Clear Signing initiative

## Prerequisite

This implementation is currently for EVM chains only. Stay tuned for other protocols.

## How to implement this clear signing method?

### dApps

The clear signing standard that we have developped relies on the whitelisting of smart contracts methods and messages and can be done easily and quickly.

#### Whitelisting process

1. Submit a Json file to describe formatting for your smart contract data, transforming it into human-readable information to be displayed on Ledger devices. 
	- The specifications for this Json file are on [the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry/blob/master/specs/erc-7730.md)
	- The PR requirements are [on the Repository ReadMe](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/clear-signing-erc7730-registry).
2. Ledger reviews your PR

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	It is possible to submit your PRs but since the Generic Parser is not released yet, the transactions will not be clear signed. The Generic Parser serves as the middle-layer deployed on the Ledger infrastructure to read and parse the JSON files. 
	We recommend you submit the PR nonetheless so that your contract is clear signed as soon as the generic parser is released. 
</Callout>


#### Special cases

- For EIP-712 messages follow [this documentation](./eip712)
- For for ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC20 follow [this documentation](./nft)
- If applicable, [add your token](..tokens/integrating-tokens) in Ledger Live.
- Some special cases may require the development of an [Ethereum plugin](../device-app/develop/code/plugin). The Ledger team will guide you through this process if required.


### Wallets

All you have to do is use the latest version of the [LedgerJS Ethereum transport library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/b2163a6eaafd46390d4a14bad8e62fcc10454c05/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-eth). It has been updated for the new standard. For more information on how to use the LedgerJS libraries read [this documentation](./connectivity/ledgerJS).

## Watch the "Request for Comment Session"

To get an insight about our process and plan for the future of clear signing, we recommend you watching the "Request for Comment Session". You can read [the slides](https://www.keepandshare.com/doc13/view.php?id=32202&da=y).

## What's next?

- Publication of an open source Json edition tool to write the json description and display the information that the user will see on their devices,
- Decentralization of the peer review process, 
- Generalization of the Json standard to the Web3 ecosystem, 
- Extension of this process to other protocols. 

Stay tuned for further updates and evolutions on this topic as we continue to improve and expand our security measures, ensuring the highest protection for our users.
