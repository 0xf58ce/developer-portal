# Enhancing Security through Clear Signing

## Why does your dApp or Wallet need clear signing?

Blind signing is a significant vulnerability that scammers exploit to steal funds from unsuspecting users. If the only information given to the user is the transaction hash, it is challenging for users to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the transaction before signing, because it is unreadable.

At Ledger, we are committed to building a secure Web3 ecosystem. That is why we have introduced clear signing standards and tools to address this issue. These tools provide user-readable and understandable data, making it easier for users to identify potential risks and verify transactions accurately.

Using the ABI of the contract and metadata around the different fields, we can format a transaction for human readability. This way, users can verify the transaction before signing it, massively reducing the risk of scams.

## Where to go next?

- If you work on a dApp and wants to make clear signing possible for your user, follow two steps:
  - Follow the [ERC7730](./erc7730) to be ready when our new and simplified clear signing process is ready.
  - Start the process [to develop and submit an plugin](../device-app/getting-started).
- If you want to allow clear signing of an EIP-712 message, [read this documentation](./eip712)
- For ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC20 NFTs, follow [this documentation](./nft)
- If you already use LedgerJS Ethereum transport library for device interaction, make sure to use [the latest version](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/b2163a6eaafd46390d4a14bad8e62fcc10454c05/libs/ledgerjs/packages/hw-app-eth)
