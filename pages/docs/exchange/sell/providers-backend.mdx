## Endpoints needed for Sell

In order to communicate with Ledgerâ€™s backend, you must provide standardised APIs for Ledger's SELL aggregator services to call.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ”—">
You will find all the information regarding the SELL endpoints here: https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/.
</Callout>

There are 4 main endpoints needed for the sell:
    - To get the list of available fiat, country, payment, method and amount: [/capabilities](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getCapabilities).
    - To get the list of available crypto-currencies: [/crypto-currencies](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getCryptoCurrencies).
    - To get the fiat amount that the user should expect -after all fees are deducted - as a payment for the given crypto amount: [/quotes](https://exchange-integration-sell.redoc.ly/#operation/getQuote).
    - To create a signed sell binary payload: /sell.

    Your Protobuf message should have the following structure:

    ```go copy
    syntax = "proto3";
    package ledger_sell;

    // (coefficient) * 10^(- exponent)
    message UDecimal {
        bytes  coefficient = 1;
        uint32 exponent = 2;
    }

    message NewSellResponse {
        string   trader_email = 1;           
        string   in_currency = 2;            
        bytes    in_amount = 3;              
        string   in_address = 4;             
        string   out_currency = 5;           
        UDecimal out_amount = 6;             
        bytes    device_transaction_id = 7;  
    }
    ```

[//]: # (Info needed to be exchange with the provider, but not out loud publicly)
[//]: # (**IP address checking** )
[//]: # (Additionally, we also need a way to know if a user will be able to perform a coin swap given his IP.)
[//]: # (Our back-end can adapt to how you decide to do this, but we recommend you use a dedicated endpoint. Our back-end will send the userâ€™s IP address to that endpoint, without logging it. In response, your endpoint should tell us if the trade is accepted or rejected.)



## Payload & Signature

Here is a little diagram to explain how the `payload` and the `signature` are generated:

      src="/exchange/payload-signature-generation-sell.png"
    />
</Zoom>

- `payload`: the trade parameters are assembled in a [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) message. Then using the protobuf tools we do a [binary encoding](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) of the protobuf (Byte Array). Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `payload` field.
- `signature`: From the binary encoding of the previous [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) (Byte Array), we sign it with [ES256](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ES256) and the provider's private key to get a Signature Byte Array. Finally, with [base64Url encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) we get the `signature` field ([more details](#jws-signature)).

### Signature usage

- Payload and Signature  
From the provider to Ledger Live. The payload is a protobuf message containing the trade data. It is generated by the provider and sent to Ledger Live.
```go copy
type Payload struct {
  trader_email,
  in_currency,
  in_amount,
  in_address,
  out_currency,
  out_amount,
  device_transaction_id,
}
R, S := Sign(payload, privKey)
```

- Validate  
Exchange app checks and validates the payload (signature and content).
```go copy
// Compare nonce in payload
Verify((R, S), payload, pubKey)
```

- Display  
Exchange app requests approval to the user by displaying the operation summary on screen. 
```c copy
Validate?
Send currency_from amount_to_provider
Receive currency_to amount_to_wallet
```
