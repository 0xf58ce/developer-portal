# What do we need

In order to become a native Sell provider in the Ledger Live ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API and endpoints to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured Payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Prepare your public key and secure your private key.

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Exchange SDK in addition to the Wallet API.
- Configure some Deeplinks to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in Ledger Live. 
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration as much as possible with some tools we provide, and submit:
  - your API, 
  - your LiveApp Manifest,
  - your Public key.

</Steps>

In the following pages, you will find:
- [Backend](sell/providers-backend): details on the main endpoints needed for the chosen operation, the payload, the signature, and your public/private key.
- [LiveApp](sell/providers-liveapp): details on your LiveApp specifities, such as the deeplink's format, or the use of Exchange SDK instead of the Wallet API.
- [Test & Submit](sell/providers-test-and-submit): details on how to use the Ledger Live Developer Mode and other tools (coming soon) to test your integration end-to-end, as well as how to submit it.
