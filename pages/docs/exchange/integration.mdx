# What do we need

In order to become a native service provider in the Ledger Live ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API and endpoints to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured Payload and a signature with a specific format.*
- Prepare your public key and secure your private key.*

### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Exchange SDK in addition to the Wallet API.*
- Configure some Deeplinks to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in Ledger Live. 
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration as much as possible with some tools we provide, and submit:
  - your API, 
  - your LiveApp Manifest,
  - your Public key.*

</Steps>
