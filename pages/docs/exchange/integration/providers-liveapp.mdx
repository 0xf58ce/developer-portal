# Provider's Live App

As explained is [How-to integrate](../integration) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the Ledger's [exchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Wallet API.*
  - Respond to some deeplinks in order to adapt to the flow inside Ledger Live.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, Manifest file.* 
  - Follow specifics flow/ux requirements.

*: Not needed for BUY. 

## Ledger's exchange SDK

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the swap/sell/buy/fund, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../../discover).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

Check the following tabs according to the operation (swall/sell/buy/fund) that you want to integrate:

<Tabs items={['Swap', 'Sell', 'Fund']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  **swap** method: This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `quoteId`: the id coming from your system and [forwarded to your LiveApp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the liveapp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `toAccountId`: user's account id, [previously given to the liveapp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter
* `fromAmount`: amount that will be sent from `fromAddressId` to `payinAddress`
* `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.
* `rate`: rate differences in the pair, [previously given to the liveapp](./providers-liveapp) as a query parameter

```js copy
  exchangeSDK.swap({
    quoteId: "1234",
    fromAccountId: "07AB5930-C73A-433F-A2FA-920640AF3A02",
    toAccountId: "76A239EB-1C2A-4237-B942-CA87472106EB",
    fromAmount: "12.3",
    feeStrategy: "SLOW",
    rate: 0.7555,    
  });
```

## Deeplink

The LiveApp needs to respond to a deeplink with some parameters. Deeplinks are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that te user already entered in Ledger Live.

The deeplink format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../APIs/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername`).

The query params for the deeplink may vary depending on the operation:

<Tabs items={['Swap', 'Sell', 'Buy', 'Fund']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  * `quoteId`: The id retrieved by Ledger's backend during a quote request.
  * `fromAmount`: The amount of currency.
  * `fromAccountId`: The user's account id in Ledger Live repository.
  * `toAccountId`: The user's account id in Ledger Live repository.
  * `rate`: the rate differences in the pair.
  * `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.
  * `initFeeTotalValue`: initial transaction total fee.
  * `customFeeConfig`(optional, required for `CUSTOM` feeStrategy): Custom fee configuration in case the strategy is of type `CUSTOM`. The key-value object is encoded in URI parameter.
  * `ledger-transaction-id`: id used by ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.

__Example__:
```
ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername?quoteId=1234&fromAmount=0.09&fromAccountId=82f48c06-6170-536e-a21b-56b30b02b58d&toAccountId=c0c4493e-fc4b-50b6-b1a0-566f1a751521&rate=79.09405555555555555556&feeStrategy=CUSTOM&initFeeTotalValue=878198522989412&customFeeConfig=%7B%22maxFeePerGas%22%3A%2212000000000%22%2C%22maxPriorityFeePerGas%22%3A%221000000000%22%2C%22userGasLimit%22%3Anull%2C%22gasLimit%22%3A%2221000%22%7D
