# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Card Integration](../card) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Use the Ledger's [exchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), in addition to the Wallet API.
  - Have a modified, slightly more complex, Manifest file.
  - Follow specifics flow/ux requirements.


## Ledger's exchange SDK

To learn how to create (or embed if already existing) your user interface for the sell, please follow the [Discover documentation](../../discover).

Your LiveApp will interact with Ledger Live, through the [ExchangeSDK](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/exchange-sdk), with the corresponding method.

You will need to set up the SDK with your `providerId` attributed upon request by Ledger.

### FUND method

This method will need you to provide the following parameters:

* `userId`: the id coming from your system 
* `accountId`: Ledger Live user account id retrieved from the Wallet API
* `accountName`: funded account name ex: Card 1234
* `inCurrency`: Crypto currency used for the funding
* `inAmount`: Amount of the crypto currency to fund
* `inAddress`: Address where the crypto currency should be sent
* `outCurrency`: Fiat currency used for the funding (optional)
* `outAmount`: Amount of the fiat currency to fund (optional)
* `Provider`: Your providerId
* `feeStrategy`: `SLOW`, `MEDIUM`, `FAST` or `CUSTOM`.


```js copy
  exchangeSDK.fund({
    userId: "1234",
    accountId: "07AB5930-C73A-433F-A2FA-920640AF3A02"
    accountName: "07AB5930-C73A-433F-A2FA-920640AF3A02",
    inCurrency: "eth",
    inAmount: "0.1",
    inAddress: "0xc0ffee254729296a45a3885639AC7E10F9d54979",
    outCurrency: "eur",
    outAmount: "100",
    provider: "myProviderId",
    feeStrategy: "MEDIUM",
  });
```

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../docs/discover/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
  "custom.exchange.start", 
  "custom.exchange.complete",
]
```
