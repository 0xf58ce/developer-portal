# What do we need

In order to become a native Card provider in the Ledger Live ecosystem, you must:

<Steps>
### Develop/Modify your LiveApp
 
- Use our Exchange SDK in addition to the Wallet API.
- Provide a set of query parameters to access your LiveApp directly with the quote entered by the user in Ledger Live. 
- Write/Modify the Manifest file. 
- Follow some flow/UX requirements.

### Adapt to our Backend
 
- Adapt your API and endpoints to interact with our Backend.
- Generate a structured Payload and a signature with a specific format.
- Send your public key to Ledger and secure your private key.

### Test and submit

Test end-to-end your integration by manually loading your LiveApp through Developer Mode (see [Wallet API doc](https://wallet.api.live.ledger.com/docs/discover/dapp-browser/manifest#load-your-live-app-locally-on-desktop)) and submit:
  - your API, 
  - your LiveApp Manifest,
  - your Public key.

</Steps>

In the following pages, you will find:
- [LiveApp](fund/providers-liveapp): details on your LiveApp specifities, such as the LiveApp URL, the Manifest or the use of Exchange SDK instead of the Wallet API.
- [Backend](fund/providers-backend): details on the main endpoints needed for the chosen operation, the payload, the signature, and your public/private key.
- [Test & Submit](fund/providers-test-and-submit): details on how to use the Ledger Live Developer Mode and other tools (coming soon) to test your integration end-to-end, as well as how to submit it.
