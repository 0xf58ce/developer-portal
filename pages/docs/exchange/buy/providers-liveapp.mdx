# Provider's LiveApp

As explained in the [Sell Integration](../sell) page, you need to modify your LiveApp with some particularities compared to the one that can be found in the Discover section.

Your LiveApp must: 
  - Respond to some deeplinks in order to adapt to the flow inside Ledger Live.
  - Follow specifics flow/ux requirements.


## Deeplink

The LiveApp needs to respond to a deeplink with some parameters. Deeplinks are used to open your LiveApp with the quote values that te user already entered in Ledger Live.

The deeplink format is already fixed and will depend on the information you provided inside your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../APIs/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) (ex: `ledgerlive://discover/swapprovidername`).


  * `account-address`: Destination address to deposit the crypto.
  * `crypto-currency`: The crypto currency that the user wants to buy. It will contain the providerId value to identify the crypto.
  * `fiat-currency`: The fiat cureency that the user wants to spend.
  * `fiat-amount`: The fiat amount that the user wants to spend.
  * `crypto-amount`: The crypto amount that the user wants to buy.
  * `mode`: `buy` or `sell`. In this case always `buy`. Required you share the same base widget url for both usages.
  * `payment-method`: The preferred payment method for the user.
  * `bank-residency`(optional): The bank residency of the user.
  * `ledger-transaction-id`: id used by ledger to track transactions and their completion statuses.

__Example__:
```
https://buy.provider.widget.com?[account-address]=x0â€¦&[crypto-currency]=BTC&[fiat-currency]=EUR&[fiat-amount]=50&[payment-method]=visa
```


<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ‘‰">

## Manifest Permission
Your [LiveApp manifest](../../../../APIs/wallet-api/appendix/manifest) should contains at least those permissions request:
```json copy
"permissions": [
  "account.list",
  "currency.list",
]
```
