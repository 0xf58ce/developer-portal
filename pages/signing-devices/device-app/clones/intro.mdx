# Clone Applications

## 1 Introduction

### What is a clone?

A variant, or clone, embedded app is developed when all the logic for signing transactions can be contained in the parent coin Embedded Application.

As for any Embedded Application, you must follow our guidelines to comply with Ledger publication requirements.

### Which development process for your Ethereum clone?

Depending on your derivation path, the process will vary. 
- If you use the same path as Ethereum (44/60), follow [the process number 1](./eth-app-update/)
- If you use a different path, follow [the process number 2](./eth-clones/)

### Get in touch with the Ledger developer community

Joining Discord is not required to code your Embedded Application, but it will be easier to meet with our team and discuss the specifics of your project. Join us on the [Ledger's Discord server](https://developers.ledger.com/discord/) and introduce your project in the **#dev-support** channel.

### What if my coin is a Bitcoin clone?

##### New Bitcoin clone

For any other clone type, use the [main Embedded App process](../introduction/).

##### Update an existing clone

If your Bitcoin clone was included in the Bitcoin Embedded App and you need to update it, please start a [new Embedded App process](../introduction/).
