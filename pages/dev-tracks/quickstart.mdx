# Quickstart guides

 In the Ledger Developer Portal, there are several types of applications that developers can create and integrate. 

- The primary kind of apps are called Device Apps
	The terminology "Devie Apps" include Classical Device Apps, dApp Plugins, Cloned coins apps. Device Apps are fundamental as they manage crypto-assets on Ledger devices, forming the gateway for integrating coins or tokens into the Ledger environment, including Ledger Live
- Device Interaction with a third party app
	For your own application, the "Device Interaction" section will help you handle multiple aspects of connecting and communicating with Ledger hardware wallets with the Device Management Kit (DMK). 
- Integration of a Blockchain in the Ledger Live application
	This integration ensures that a blockchain can be fully supported within Ledger Live, providing users with features such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency, displaying account balances, and tracking operation histories.
- In addition to native apps, the Ledger Developer Portal supports the development of Live Apps
	They are decentralized applications designed to integrate with Ledger Live, facilitating secure interaction with web3 projects. They can be integrated using either the dAppBrowser, which is currently limited to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, or the more comprehensive Ledger Services Kit, providing granular control over core wallet features.
