# Test your Integration End-to-End

The end-to-end testing process is a bit more complex than for the regular LiveApp found in the Discover section.

You will need to enable developer mode in Ledger Live. Please refer to the [Developer Mode](../../discover/developer-mode) article for more details.

<Steps>
### Test your LiveApp

To test your LiveApp, you will need to:

- Go to Ledger Live and open your LiveApp in debug mode.
- Use a hardware wallet with the Exchange App installed to load an account.

If you need to debug, you can use the LiveApp debug tools.

### Test the Backend

After testing your LiveApp and ensuring it works with the Exchange App, you should test the backend. Point your LiveApp to your own backend and check if it functions correctly.

</Steps>

# Submit

<Steps>
### Your API

Adapt your API to interact with our backend, with some specific requirements. Details are available in the [Backend](providers-backend) section.

### Your LiveApp's Manifest

This is more complex than the regular LiveApp Manifest in the Discover section. Details are in the [LiveApp](providers-liveapp) section.
