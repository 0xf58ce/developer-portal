# Test your integration end-to-end 

The end-to-end test process is a bit more complex than for the regular LiveApp found in the Discover section. 

You will need to enable the developer mode in Ledger Live. 
Please refer to the [Developer Mode](../../discover/developer-mode) article for more details.

<Steps>
### Test your LiveApp
   
To test your LiveApp, you will have to: 
- Go to Ledger Live and open your LiveApp in debug mode.
- Use a Nano hardware wallet with the exchange app installed. 

If you need to debug, you can use the LiveApp debug tools.

### Test the Backend
 
After testing your LiveApp and making sure it works with the Exchange App, you should now test the backend. You can make your LiveApp point to your own Backend and check if it works.
