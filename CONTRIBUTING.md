## Branch Naming 

- Use short, clear and descriptive Names: When naming branches, aim for clarity by providing immediate context about their purpose. For example, use names like feature/login or bugfix/navbar-overflow.

- Use hyphens to separate wordes: Adopt hyphens to separate words in branch names for improved readability. For instance, bugfix/fix-login-issue is easier to understand than bugfix/fixLoginIssue or bugfix/fix_login_issue. Avoid unecessary hyphens (a name like feat/new — login- is not advisable).

- Use only lowercase alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0–9) along with hyphens. 

- Use Prefixes for organization:
	- feature/: For creating new features.
	- bugfix/: For addressing code bugs, often linked to a specific issue.
	- hotfix/: For fixing critical production bugs.
	- release/: For preparing a new release, handling tasks like final touches and revisions.
	- docs/: For updating, modifying, or correcting documentation.

- Add ticket Numbers: If your project uses an issue tracking system like Jira or GitHub issues, incorporate the issue token into the branch name for easier tracking. For instance, feature/PROJ-123-footer-links.
